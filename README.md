## Demo

A demo of this API is located at: https://vue-demo.daniel-avellaneda.com

### Login credentials:

email: `admin@admin.com`  
password: `12345`

**IMPORTANT:** Database resets every 30 mins like "12:00am, 12:30am, 1:00am" and so on. So anything you do with the API will be lost after a short time.

Demo is also linked to a VueJS project that shows how this frontend can be integrated to an API.
